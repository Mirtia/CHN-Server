## TODO

- [ ] Add replicas support (good for automation) `or` generate multiple compose files: *cowrie-1*, *cowrie-2* with increasing assigned range. I already have some silly scripts that I can improve.
- [ ] See issue with deploy-key `or` maybe remove the deploy-key entirely, see how you can integrate the script Danae made.
- [ ] [Known hosts for the containers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learn-how-access-docker-container-its-name-from-host-renato-rodrigues/) May be useful when trying out the botnet.
